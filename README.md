# The Application runs Jolt-core library as a UI client in local .

- Front end UI : react
- Back end : Java - spring boot
- Build : Maven would build node and package manager .

To run the application in maven use below comman:
`mvn spring-boot:run -Pprod`

Inspiration is from the Jolt demo tool already available , this UI is intended mainly to be used for using jolt UI in local to use custom functions.
